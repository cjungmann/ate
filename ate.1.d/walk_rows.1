.SS WALK_ROWS
.PP
Repeatedly invokes a callback function with a row index value and
the name of an array containing a row's contents.
If the
.IR starting_row " and " row_count
parameters are used, they will determine which rows are processed.
Otherwise, every table row will be sent to the callback function.
.PP
If the callback function returns 0 or nothing, the next row will be
sent.
If the callback function return non-0, the row walk
will be terminated.

.I callback
to a script function that

.BI "-k " sorting_key
provides a key to use for ordering the rows.
If
.I sorting_key
is  specified, the
.IR starting_row " and " row_count
options will refer to row indexes in the key table, usually as
returned by a call to the
.B seek_key
action.
.TP
.BI "-s " starting_row
If specified, this is the (0-based) row number of the first
row to be sent to the callback function.
.TP
.BI  "-c " row_count
If specified (following the
.IR starting_row ),
this is the number of rows to send to the callback function.

The callback function will get the following arguments:

tab(|) center;
l lx.
\(Do1|T{
.B row array name
of the array containing a copy of the row's contents as found
in the source table
T}
\(Do2|T{
.B row index
of the data in the source table
T}
\(Do3|T{
.B table name
where the row data was taken
T}
\(Do4|T{
.BR "sorted index" ,
the index of the row in the sorting key
T}
\&...|T{
optional
.B extra arguments
passed to the \fBwalk_rows\fP action.
T}
.TE
.PP
The first three arguments provide the information needed to call the
.B put_row
action to update the source table with changed row contents.
.PP
The fourth argument is the index value of the row in the sorted order,
which may be different from the source table order if the
.B -k
option is used.
