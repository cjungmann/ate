.SS REINDEX_ELEMENTS
.PP
.proto_reindex_elements
.PP
This reassigns the internal index number of the Bash array elements
according to the indexed order of the rows.
It is automatically called when resizing rows because adding columns
results in the addition of new elements between existing consecutive
array elements.
.PP
This function may also be useful to reorder the Bash array after
a sort.
Recalling that a sort does not change the order of an array's
elements, calling
.B reindex_elements
will reorder and reindex the elements in the sorted order.
