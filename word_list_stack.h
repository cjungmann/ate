 * @defgroup WLE_Group WORD_LINK Creation Macros
 *
 * @brief Set of macros for creating or extending a WORD_LIST in
 *        stack memory.
 *
 * The primary macros from this group are @ref WL_WALK and
 * @ref WL_APPEND.
 *
 * @anchor WLE_Def
 * The macros create "WORD_LIST entries," otherwise known as
 * **WLE** blocks.  A WLE is a single block of memory containing a
 * WORD_LIST struct, a WORD_DESC struct, and bytes to contain a
 * NULL-terminated string.  After initialization, The `word` member
 * of the WORD_LIST struct points to the WORD_DESC struct, whose
 * `word` member points to the string at the end of the WLE.

 * member of the contained WORD_DESC::word member.

/**
 * @page WLE_Intro WLE Intro
 * The Bash builtin library seems not to have a function for adding
 * a new link to a WORD_LIST, so this is my solution for that need.
 *
 * Further, since my usage of WORD_LISTs is ad hoc and temporary,
 * this solution creates the new or augmented WORD_LIST in stack
 * memory for ease of cleanup.
 *
 * Conceptually, this could be done with *inline* functions, but
 * since the allocations are from the stack, and I'm not sure how
 * or even if it's possible to *guarantee* a function will be inline,
 * I resorted to macros.
 *
 * @warning Using stack memory for WORD_LISTs can have unexpected
 * problems.  Look at this @ref WLE_Warning
 *
 * The best practice for appending to an existing WORD_LIST chain is
 * to save a pointer to the pre-existing tail so its `next` pointer
 * can be reset to NULL when the function returns.
 */

/**
 * @page WLE_Warning Warning About Stack-based Entries
 *
 * Be careful when using @ref WL_APPEND and @ref WL_WALK to extend
 * an existing WORD_LIST, especially if the existing WORD_LIST will
 * live on after the function returns.
 *
 * @ref WL_APPEND and @ref WL_WALK create WORD_LIST entries
 * (@ref WLE_def) in stack memory using *alloca*.  If a pre-existing
 * WORD_LIST from another stack frame or in heap memory is extended
 * with entries from one of these macros, the `next` member of the
 * last WORD_LIST element will point to an invalid memory location
 * when the function of the stack-based WORD_LIST entries returns.
 *
 * If it is only a temporary extension, save a pointer to the `tail`
 * of the pre-existing WORD_LIST so the `next` member can be
 * reset to NULL before the function terminates.
 *
 * ~~~c
void append(WORD_LIST *list)
