# PROJECT ARRAY TABLE EXTENSION

Turn a Bash array into a quick-access virtual table.

## INTRODUCTION

This builtin module enhances Bash arrays in two major ways:
It allows for direct random access to elements, and it provides an
interface through which the array will present as a table;






## ALTERNATE NAMES

I've considered `bat` for **Bash Array Table**, but decided against
competing with [bat][bat].

Using `ate` for now, but alternative names (in case `ate` seems
inappropriate) might be `bia` for **Bash Indexed Array** or `iat` for
**Indexed Array Table**.
